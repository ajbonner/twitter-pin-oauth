# twitter-pin-oauth

## Description
I wrote this for a simple tool I wanted to cleanup some spam bot followers. Many (all) of the npm modules didn't work at all
and none appeared to support pin based authentication. So I wrote one.

## Requirements
I wrote this as a proof of concept using ES6 syntax. You require node > 6, and I have tested this against node 6.2.

## Usage 
```Usage: $ node TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="" TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="" bin/auth.js```

## Licence
MIT
